## Future Update: Admin Page Implementation

In the next update, we plan to introduce an admin page to provide administrators with control over sports tickets, including the ability to add new products and manage orders and inquiries. This feature will enhance the functionality of the application and streamline the administrative tasks associated with managing ticket sales.

### Features to be Implemented

- **Admin Dashboard**: The admin page will include a dashboard providing an overview of product listings, orders, and inquiries.

- **Product Management**: Admins will be able to add, edit, and delete products from the inventory. This functionality will enable them to keep the ticket listings up to date and relevant.

- **Order Management**: Admins will have access to a list of orders placed by users. They can view order details, mark orders as processed, and update order statuses.

- **Inquiry Management**: The admin page will allow administrators to view and respond to inquiries submitted by users. They can mark inquiries as resolved once they have been addressed.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Access to the admin page will be restricted to authorized administrators. Authentication mechanisms will ensure that only authorized users can access the admin features.
